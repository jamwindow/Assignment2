In my work, I have put multi VLAN for 3 site. 10 VLAN (5 are for wire and others are for wireless) for 2 building in main site and 6 VLAN (3 are for wire and others are for wireless) for 2 other sites. At the edge router of each site, I run NAT for translating local IP to public ip and use GRE tunnel to ping computers each site.
